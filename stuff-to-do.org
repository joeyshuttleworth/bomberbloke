** TODO Create "camera" class 
   This should allow for different camera modes like "follow" (with deadzone) and "all" as well as basic camera shaking effects.
** TODO Create particle and animation classes
    Animation should be used by particle and actor to update sprites (using a sprite sheet). This is more important for "particles" because 
    we _need_ an explosion effect for the bomb.
** TODO [low priority] A SoundEffect class
** TODO A splash / loading screen - should be animated.
